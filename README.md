# Kirby Air Ride Ingition
Kirby Air Ride Deluxe is a collection of mods powered by the [hoshi](https://github.com/UnclePunch/hoshi) framework with an emphasis on customization and familiar aesthetics. Many new menus and UI elements are included to improve the user experience. All features are toggleable and their settings save to the Ini file for syncing in KARphin.

# Is this not just Deluxe?

[KAR Deluxe](https://github.com/UnclePunch/KAR-Deluxe) is a mod made by [Uncle Punch](https://github.com/UnclePunch). Ignition is based on his work but expands it. Adding more machine slots, changes to the Hoshi framework and adds in bits from the Decomp. The main reason to make another mod is my changes are so drastic, it wouldn't work with his mod. Ideally some of the changes can be merged back into his or Hoshi as a whole.
